# Plugin
Demonstrates how to create plugins by copying two examples plugins (BlankPlugin
and UObjectPlugin) shipped with UE4 into the Plugins folder.

Also includes a plugin called DeveloperSettingsExample that demonstrates how to
add settings to the Project Setttings editor, which stores values in config
files. This example also shows how the different config options effect where
the values are stored in the config files.
